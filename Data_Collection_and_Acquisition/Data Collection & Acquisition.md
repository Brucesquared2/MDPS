🔷 1.2 – Time Handling & Candle Construction
Purpose:
 This module ensures that all incoming market data is accurately time-aligned, timestamp-consistent, and properly aggregated into standardized candle structures. It’s essential for precise backtesting, real-time analysis, and multi-timeframe modeling.

🧩 Components:
Time Sync Engine (build script)
Maintains synchronization between local system time, broker/server time, and exchange time.
Corrects for timezone offsets, daylight saving time, and millisecond-level drift.
Acts as a foundation for consistent candle generation and execution scheduling.

Dynamic candle types (adaptive range, volume, or volatility bars)
Clean sampling with adjustable fidelity based on market state


🔷 1.3 – Data Validation & Integrity Assurance
Purpose:
 This module ensures the reliability, cleanliness, and traceability of incoming data feeds. It performs real-time checks to detect missing values, spikes, inconsistencies, or corrupt records before data is stored or processed. It's essential for maintaining model accuracy and debugging trust.

🧩 Components:
**Live Feed Validator (build script or Pandas DataFrame-based validation)
Validates data structure, format, and expected fields (e.g., Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
Performs checks on timestamp continuity, value ranges, and missing values.
Works both in streaming (real-time) mode and batch (historical) mode.
**Data Anomaly Detector (e.g., using scipy.stats.zscore(), IQR, or rolling std deviation)
Detects outliers and anomalies such as sudden spikes, frozen prices, or gaps.
Supports customizable statistical methods:
Z-score thresholding (e.g., abs(z) > 3)
Interquartile Range (IQR)
Rolling standard deviation anomaly detection
Automatically flags suspect rows or triggers alerts/logs.
**Feed Integrity Logger (Python’s logging system)
Maintains detailed logs of all validation checks, issues, and data quality warnings.
Supports rotation, severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR), and optional output to a database or flat files.
Useful for debugging and audit trails.
**Feed Source Tagger (build script)
Attaches metadata to each incoming data row or candle (e.g., source, instrument ID, timestamp origin).
Enables tracking data lineage across multi-source pipelines.
Helps diagnose issues when merging multiple data streams (e.g., MT5 + Binance).

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

loguru – for more elegant and structured logging
Optional integration with prometheus_client or influxdb for real-time feed health monitoring
Tagging & Metadata:
Custom scripts to insert source_id, timestamp_type, or data_version as columns
Store in structured formats (Parquet/Feather) for traceability

📦 Example Outputs:
✅ Validated dataframes with clean structure and continuous time
⚠️ Anomaly detection flags like:
 Anomaly: OHLCV spike at 2025-07-30 12:05, z=4.3
🧾 Logs with tracebacks, source info, and anomaly summaries
🏷️ Data tagged with origin (e.g., "MetaTrader5-EURUSD", "Binance-BTCUSDT") for full transparency


🔷 1.4 – Data Storage & Profiling
Purpose:
 This module is responsible for temporarily holding, permanently archiving, and profiling collected data. It ensures that all incoming data is safely stored, properly backed up, and well-understood through profiling and inspection. It provides resilience (fallback storage), efficiency (compressed formats), and insights (data characteristics).

🧩 Components:
**Data Buffer & Fallback Storage (Python queue or collections.deque)
Temporarily stores live data streams before they’re written to disk.
Acts as a buffer to handle spikes in data rate or delays in disk I/O.
Ensures no data is lost during network glitches or processing slowdowns.
Can implement FIFO or ring buffer behavior.
Useful for storing last N ticks or candles in memory.
**Raw Data Archiver (Parquet / Feather / CSV formats)
Persists raw collected data for historical analysis, audits, or future replays.
Parquet: best for large-scale, columnar, compressed storage.
Feather: ideal for speed and compatibility with pandas.
CSV: human-readable, but slower and larger in size.
Archiving can be scheduled (e.g., hourly/daily) or triggered by volume thresholds.
**Data Source Profiler (Pandas)
Generates statistical summaries for each new data batch.
Helps detect missing values, skewness, extreme ranges, or unexpected behaviors.
Useful for verifying feed health and catching early issues in new data sources.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
Buffering:
collections.deque(maxlen=5000) – efficient memory ring buffer
queue.Queue() – thread-safe option for multi-threaded pipelines
asyncio.Queue() – for async-based systems
Archiving:
pandas.to_parquet() – efficient for long-term archival
pandas.to_feather() – fast write/read for local storage or short-term caches
pandas.to_csv() – readable format for inspection/debug
Cloud integration (optional): s3fs, gcsfs for cloud archiving
Profiling:
df.describe() – basic summary statistics
df.isnull().sum() – missing value checker
df.skew(), df.kurt() – to assess data distribution
Custom profiling reports via pandas-profiling or ydata-profiling

📦 Example Outputs:
✅ Real-time memory buffer storing latest 5000 ticks
📁 Archived files like:
EURUSD_ticks_2025-07-30_00-01.parquet
BTCUSDT_ohlcv_2025-07-30.csv
📊 Profiling logs:

 Column: volume - mean: 4.25, std: 2.1, skew: 1.85, nulls: 0
🧠 Insights to inform downstream components about data quality and volume


🔷 1.5 – Pre-Cleaning & Preparation

✅ Function
The Data Sanitizer performs preliminary checks and basic cleaning tasks on raw incoming financial data. It removes obviously corrupt records, handles missing values, filters out invalid numerical entries (such as zero or negative prices), ensures consistent data types, and detects basic structural anomalies before deeper processing begins.

🧠 Role in the System
This component acts as the first defense layer against bad or malformed data. It protects downstream stages (like feature engineering or modeling) from crashes or skewed results by ensuring the incoming data meets minimum integrity requirements. It also reduces noise and prepares the dataset for high-quality analytics and modeling.

🛠️ Tools to Use
Pandas: For data manipulation, filtering, and column-wise operations
PyJanitor: For chaining cleaning steps like removing empty rows, renaming columns, etc.
Datatest: To define and enforce data constraints (e.g., value ranges, column presence)
Great Expectations: For automated validation, profiling, and maintaining data quality standards
Scikit-learn: For basic outlier detection using tools like IsolationForest
Polars (optional): For high-performance data cleaning when working with large datasets
Custom Python Scripts: For handling domain-specific cleaning logic or complex checks

🔷 1.6 – Pipeline Orchestration & Monitoring

✅ Function
This component manages the scheduling, execution, and monitoring of data pipelines. It ensures that all data processes run in the correct order, on time, and without failure. It also tracks pipeline health and triggers alerts when issues occur.

🧠 Role in the System
Pipeline Orchestration guarantees reliable, automated data workflows by coordinating dependencies between tasks. Monitoring provides real-time visibility into pipeline status, performance metrics, and failure points. Alerts notify engineers instantly to minimize downtime and maintain data freshness.

🛠️ Tools to Use
Apache Airflow or Prefect: For defining, scheduling, and managing complex workflows
Prefect UI: For live monitoring and orchestration dashboard
Prometheus + Grafana: For collecting and visualizing metrics on pipeline health and performance
Webhook Integrations (e.g., Telegram, Slack): For sending alerts and notifications to teams
Custom Alert Managers: To tailor notifications based on error types or severity
