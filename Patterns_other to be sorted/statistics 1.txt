what are the statistics on Cassiopeia Harmonic Patterns in trading
ChatGPT said:

I couldn’t find credible, published statistics specifically for “Cassiopeia Harmonic Patterns” in trading. It seems likely that either:

The term is being used informally (perhaps by a particular trader or service) rather than being a broadly studied named pattern, or

It’s conflating “harmonic patterns” (like Gartley, Butterfly, Bat, Crab) with some proprietary or non-standard naming (“Cassiopeia”) that hasn’t been validated in academic or widely accepted trading research.

Here’s what I could find and what that implies — plus suggestions if you’re looking to evaluate such patterns yourself.

🔍 What I did find

There is some reference on older sites (e.g. FxGroundworks) that claim very high success rates for “harmonic patterns” (80-95%) across nearly 3,000 patterns. 
Geocities

But these sources are not peer-reviewed, and often lack detail about sample bias, trade entry/exit rules, slippage, or selection criteria.

Such numbers should be taken with skepticism because they often reflect idealized backtests rather than live trading conditions.

I found nothing credible or detailed using the specific name “Cassiopeia Harmonic Patterns” in reputed journals, trading forums, or quant research databases. No win-rates, no statistical backtests, no comparisons vs benchmark or random entry.

⚠️ Why be cautious

Backtest bias: Just because a pattern could have worked in historical data doesn’t mean it works in future or under real‐market conditions (slippage, spread, commission all eat returns).

Survivorship / selection bias: Patterns that are named or hyped are often those that “looked good” in the past; that doesn’t mean they are robust.

Ambiguity in definitions: “Harmonic pattern” could mean different things to different people; without precise definitions (exact ratios, timeframe, entry/exit rules) the statistics are not useful.

Overfitting danger: High success claims often come from tuning a strategy very much to historical data, which may not generalize.

🔧 What you can do if you want to test “Cassiopeia Harmonic Patterns” or any custom pattern

Since you’re well-versed, you could put together your own statistical test. Here’s a rough plan:

Define the pattern exactly

What are the exact price points / Fibonacci ratios / timeframe?

What constitutes entry (e.g. after completion of pattern, certain confirmation candle)?

What is stop‐loss, take‐profit?

Gather historical data

Get decent quality historical price data for the markets you want to trade (forex, crypto, stocks, etc.).

Clean out bad ticks, account for commission/slippage.

Backtest

Using software (Python, R, or trading platforms) try applying your pattern over past data.

Measure metrics: overall win rate, profit factor, max drawdown, average profit per trade, expectancy.

Walk-forward test or paper trade

Test on unseen data (after the period used for development) to see if the pattern holds.

Or use small live trades (paper money or small capital) to see real-world behavior.

Compare with benchmarks

Compare performance vs simple strategies (moving average crossovers, etc.) to see whether your pattern provides actual added value.

Risk management

Even profitable patterns can lead to large losses if risk per trade or position sizing is poor.

If you want, I can try to dig deeper to see if any niche or paid sources have stats on "Cassiopeia Harmonic Patterns" (if you share exactly what you believe the pattern is — ratios etc.), or I can help you backtest it using some recent data. Do you want me to go that route?

what about the statistics of these Gartley, Butterfly, Bat, Crab patterns
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a summary of what I found on statistics for Gartley / Bat / Butterfly / Crab (harmonic) patterns, plus important caveats. The data is mixed, and results depend heavily on market, timeframe, pattern rules, risk management, etc.

📊 Reported Performance of Harmonic Patterns
Pattern	Reported Success Rate / Reliability	Key Findings
Gartley	~ 60-75% in many trader/backtest sources.

But in some more rigorous tests, success can drop quite a bit, especially for volatile markets or larger price moves. 
HKUST CSE

	Performs better when patterns are tight, deviation small, and markets relatively stable. Longer timeframes tend to yield more consistent results. 
HKUST CSE

Bat	Often similar or slightly better than Gartley in certain sources, e.g. ~ 65-78%. 
Forex News

investaiapp.com
+2
	The Bat pattern tends to give tighter stop-loss options (because the reversal point “D” is closer to the XA leg) which improves risk/reward when done correctly. 
investaiapp.com

Butterfly	More variability: some sources say ~ 55-70%. Some backtests show results up to ~ 80% under very favorable conditions. 
Forex News
+2
Liberated Stock Trader
+2
	More extreme extensions (D beyond X) mean more risk, so more false signals, especially if market momentum is strong or trending. Needs other confirming indicators. 
Forex News

Crab	Mixed: some sources claim ~ 60-80%, but the risk/reward is often higher, so losses in bad trades can be bigger.

	Because Crab often involves deep or extreme extensions, timing matters a lot. Slippage, extended moves, or trend continuation can hurt.

Another report (Liberated Stock Trader) gave more detailed numbers based on backtesting:

Butterfly: target hit reliability ~ 48-80% depending on market / item. 
Liberated Stock Trader

Gartley: around 36-60% in some tests, depending on timeframe and instrument. 
Liberated Stock Trader

Bat: results ranged widely (26-64%) depending on setups. 
Liberated Stock Trader

⚠️ Caveats & Why Stats Vary Widely

Definition fidelity: Many studies/trader reports don’t strictly enforce the exact Fibonacci ratios or “perfect” geometry. Slight deviations degrade performance.

Market & timeframe differences: Daily or weekly charts tend to give more reliable outcomes vs very short intraday frames.

Risk Management: How you set stop-loss, take profit, position sizing makes a huge difference. A pattern with a 70% raw hit rate might still be unprofitable if your losers are much bigger than your winners or you trade too large.

Confirmation needed: Volume, divergence, candlestick confirmation or other indicators improve results materially. Patterns alone do less well.

Backtest vs live trading: Backtests often ignore slippage, commissions, latency. Live trading tends to underperform backtest numbers.

Psychology & execution: Getting the timing right (entering at “D” zone, not earlier), avoiding false signals, and discipline matter a lot.

🔍 A More Rigorous Study

One academic/independent backtest (“Trading with Harmonic Patterns” by Hong Kong University of Science & Technology) found that:

Success / win rate for Gartley patterns falls as the deviation (how far price moves stray from ideal pattern) increases. 
HKUST CSE

In volatile markets (or large price swings), the hit rate is lower. 
HKUST CSE

✅ What This Means Practically (for You)

Expect 50-70% success rate in favorable conditions (good instruments, decent timeframe, strict pattern rules).

Profitability hinges on risk/reward, not just win rate: small loss potential + larger reward targets tend to work better.

Combine harmonic pattern detection with confirmation indicators (volume, trend, divergence) to increase the odds.

Consider automating detection & backtesting on your preferred markets/instruments to see what's working in “your patch” (stocks, forex, crypto, agri-commodities, etc.).

I looked into recent sources but couldn’t find credible academic / peer-reviewed studies (2023-2025) that give reliable live-trade statistics (win rate + profit factor) specifically for Gartley, Bat, Butterfly, and Crab patterns in U.S. stocks. Most of what’s out there are trader/backtest reports, forums, or pattern detection tools, which often have biases or aren’t rigorously documented.

Here’s a summary of what is out there, what seems more/less reliable, and what you should watch for if you try to validate these patterns yourself.

🔍 What is reported (from trader/backtest sources)

These come from hobbyist / commercial backtests rather than scientific studies, so treat them with caution.

Source	Pattern / Market	Reported Win Rate / Success Rate / Profitability
Liberated Stock Trader (recent report)	Butterfly on various stocks	~ 48% to 80% target hit rate; average profit per target hit ~ 6% 
Liberated Stock Trader

Same source	Gartley	~ 36% to 60% success rate; ~ 4% profit per trade when targets hit 
Liberated Stock Trader

Same source	Bat	~ 26% to 64% success rate; profits vary a lot (~0.25% to ~8%) depending on the trade / stock / setup 
Liberated Stock Trader

Same source	Crab	“Avoid” recommendation due to low reliability; ~ 50% hit rate; small profit per hit in many cases

⚠️ Why you should be skeptical / what to watch out for

The term “success” or “hit rate” usually means “price reaches a certain target,” not net profitability (after losses, commissions, etc.). Many traders don’t report average loss, maximum drawdown, or risk vs reward.

Backtest bias: often patterns are selected after knowing outcomes (“data mining”). They also often exclude trades that didn’t follow rules exactly.

Market differences: what works in Forex doesn’t always translate to stocks, commodities, or indices. And results depend heavily on timeframe (daily vs hourly vs minute charts).

Slippage, spread, execution delays: real performance tends to be worse than backtests.

Low sample size: some patterns don’t occur very often, so the data may not be statistically strong.

✅ What a more credible pattern of evidence might look like

To get more reliable stats, you’d want something like:

A study that defines exactly what counts as a valid Gartley, Bat, etc. (Fibonacci tolerances, price deviation, timeframe).

Backtesting over many years of data, multiple stocks / markets, with both wins & losses recorded.

Inclusion of realistic trading costs (commissions, spread, slippage).

Reporting metrics like win rate, profit factor, drawdown, max loss, average gain / trade, expectancy (i.e. how much you make on average per trade accounting for win / loss frequency).

A walk-forward or out-of-sample test (after the period used for developing/training the rules) to see how the pattern performs on fresh data.

🔧 What you might do to get your own credible stats

Since academic sources are thin, your best move might be to test them yourself (or hire someone to help):

Gather clean historical data for securities you trade (U.S. stocks or whatever).

Write or use software that detects the harmonic patterns with strict rules (Fibonacci levels, tolerances).

Backtest over multiple market conditions (bear, bull, volatile, stable) and different timeframes.

Log every trade: entry point, stop-loss, target, actual outcome, time in trade.

Use realistic estimates of trading cost & execution.

Evaluate across metrics: win rate, profit factor, expectancy, drawdowns, consistency.

If you like, I can try to build an approximate backtest summary of these patterns in U.S. stocks over recent years (say 2018-2025) using open data, to give you your own set of numbers. Do you want me to pull that together?
