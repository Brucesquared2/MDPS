BENCHMARKS

üßÆ Benchmarks & Numbers You Might Expect

Based on the sources:

Win rates typically range from 40-60% for strategies using a few indicators; combining more can push win rate higher in some studies, but often at cost of fewer trades or requiring precise conditions.

Sharpe ratios in good studies might be 1.3-2.0, especially with good risk control.

Outperformance vs baseline (buy and hold or single-indicator strategies) often in the range of 10-30% improvement in error metrics or returns (depending on market / timeframe).

Returns like ‚Äú> 50% annualized‚Äù are reported in some RL + sentiment + indicator studies, but you have to check if that includes realistic slippage, drawdown, etc. These are probably outliers.

üßÆ Example: How Your Ideal System Could Perform / Be Tested

If you built a system that includes:

Candlestick pattern detector

Swing / wave counter (swing highs / lows / Elliott Wave)

Trend indicators (MAs, ADX, trendlines)

Fibonacci retracements / extensions

Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.)

Volume & volatility filters

You‚Äôd want to test it like this:

Clean historical data (preferably minute or hourly if you're trading shorter timeframes, or daily for longer).

Automate detection of each pattern/indicator with clear rule sets (e.g. define ‚Äúwave count‚Äù algorithmically rather than manually).

Define entry and exit rules (which indicator combos needed for entry, stop loss, take profit).

Backtest across multiple markets (stocks, commodities, forex) and multiple market regimes (bull, bear, range).

Use walk-forward or rolling window test to avoid lookahead bias.

Measure standard metrics: win rate, profit factor, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, return over risk, etc.

‚úÖ What a more credible pattern of evidence might look like

To get more reliable stats, you‚Äôd want something like:

A study that defines exactly what counts as a valid Gartley, Bat, etc. (Fibonacci tolerances, price deviation, timeframe).

Backtesting over many years of data, multiple stocks / markets, with both wins & losses recorded.

Inclusion of realistic trading costs (commissions, spread, slippage).

Reporting metrics like win rate, profit factor, drawdown, max loss, average gain / trade, expectancy (i.e. how much you make on average per trade accounting for win / loss frequency).

A walk-forward or out-of-sample test (after the period used for developing/training the rules) to see how the pattern performs on fresh data.

üîç A More Rigorous Study

One academic/independent backtest (‚ÄúTrading with Harmonic Patterns‚Äù by Hong Kong University of Science & Technology) found that:

Success / win rate for Gartley patterns falls as the deviation (how far price moves stray from ideal pattern) increases.

In volatile markets (or large price swings), the hit rate is lower.

‚úÖ What These Studies Suggest in Relation to Your System

These findings map well to your described system (dashboards, multiple indicators, macro + sentiment + technical toolboxes):

Combining many signal sources + dynamically weighting them (QuantNet, Adaptive Alpha Weighting) tends to outperform static combinations.

Including macro / market regime / sentiment / volatility helps mitigate drawdowns and improves adaptability when markets move from trending to ranging, or when volatility spikes.

Using order flow / market microstructure data (as in Statistical Predictions ‚Ä¶) gives predictive value beyond just classic technical indicators ‚Äî can help improve ‚Äúedge‚Äù especially in shorter timeframe trading.

Out-of-sample testing / forward testing (as in several of these papers) is shown critical: backtests alone often mislead.

Risk metrics like Sharpe, Calmar, drawdown, profit factor, expectancy are often more meaningful than raw win rates.

üéØ Benchmarks You Could Aim For

Based on the above, if you build a quant system with multiple modules + good risk management, here are realistic performance targets to aim for:

Metric	Realistic Target Range (Well-Executed System)
Annual Return (after fees)	10%-25% (for many systems); top quant/stat arb or multi-strategy could push 25-40% in good years
Sharpe Ratio	1.0-2.5 depending on strategy type, volatility, frequency
Max Drawdown	Usually 20-40% in worst periods; fewer if you have strong regime filters or hedging
Win Rate	Hard to predict; strategy dependent. Many good systems have win rates 50-70% with good risk/reward and trade frequency
Profit Factor	1.5-3+ is good; 3+ is very strong (if realistic costs considered)

üéØ What You Can Use These For (Benchmarks & Targets)

Based on these real numbers, here are some target ranges you might aim for (depending on strategy / risk):

Goal Type	Realistic Target Range	Conditions / Strategy Notes
Moderate quant / mixed-indicator approach	10-15% annually (if you control costs, good signal filtering)	Probably with moderate turnover, solid risk management, possibly hybrid strategy (macro + technical + sentiment)
Higher-risk / more specialized quant niche (stat arb, EMN, macro quant)	15-25%+ in strong periods, possibly more in trending/volatile regimes	Will need sophisticated models, resources, good execution, minimal operational friction
Downside / drawdown control	Limit drawdowns to 20-30% (ideally less) for equity-focused quant; worse for CTAs or macro in trending reversals	Use regime filters, stop-loss, hedge where possible

üéØ Benchmarks You Can Aim For

Based on those, here are some ‚Äúgoals / target zones‚Äù you might set for your system, to be competitive and realistic:

Metric	Good Target (for your level, with moderate risk)	Stretch Target (if optimized, good data, great execution)
Annualized return (live, after costs)	10-20%	20-30%+ (or more in high volatility / favorable regime)
Sharpe Ratio (net of costs)	~1.2-1.8	2.0+ (hard, but achievable in some quant/stat arb niches)
Max Drawdown in a bad year / crisis period	20-30%	15-25% with good regime filters
Win Rate	Depends on strategy; for stat arb maybe ~40-60%, for trend-following maybe ~50-70% with fewer trades	
Correlation vs Market (Beta)	Keeping low or modest beta helps risk; ideally <0.5 if market neutral-ish strategies
