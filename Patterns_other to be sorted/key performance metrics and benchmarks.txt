key performance metrics and benchmarks for quantitative (quant) and algorithmic trading strategies, drawing from recent studies and industry standards.

ðŸ“Š Key Performance Metrics for Quantitative Strategies

Sharpe Ratio: Measures risk-adjusted returns by comparing excess returns to volatility. A ratio above 2.0 is considered strong. 
LuxAlgo

Maximum Drawdown (MDD): Indicates the largest loss from peak to trough. Lower drawdowns (<15%) are preferred for better capital preservation. 
LuxAlgo

Profit Factor: Compares total profits to total losses. A value above 1.75 suggests strong performance. 
LuxAlgo

Win Rate: The percentage of profitable trades. For trend-following strategies, typical win rates range from 20% to 40%, while mean reversion strategies often have higher win rates. 
Quantified Strategies

Expectancy: Calculates the average profit or loss per trade over time. A positive expectancy indicates a strategy is likely to be profitable in the long run. 
LuxAlgo

ðŸ“ˆ Industry Benchmarks and Success Rates

Hedge Fund Performance: Quantitative hedge funds often target higher risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio) compared to traditional hedge funds. However, absolute returns depend on factors like leverage and volatility tolerance. 
Aurum

Day Trading Success: Only 13% of day traders maintain consistent profitability over six months, and a mere 1% succeed over five years. 
Quantified Strategies

Quantitative Trading Success: Less than 2% of individuals succeed in quantitative trading unless they are part of large institutions.

ðŸ§ª Evaluating Your Quantitative System

Given your multi-layered scoring system, consider the following:

Backtesting: Ensure your backtests simulate real-world conditions, including slippage and transaction costs. 
QuantVPS

Diversification: Incorporate a mix of strategies (e.g., trend-following, mean reversion) to balance risk and return.

Risk Management: Implement position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms to protect against significant drawdowns.

Performance Metrics: Regularly monitor metrics like Sharpe ratio, MDD, and profit factor to assess strategy effectiveness.
