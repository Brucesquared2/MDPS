üîß Recommendations to Improve Your System

Given what the research says, here are ways to make your weighted dashboard/quant system more robust / increase its chances of success:

Feature Selection & Weight Calibration

Don‚Äôt assign weights arbitrarily; use statistical methods (PCA, regularization, cross-validation) to discover which indicators contribute most to predictive power.

Maybe have dynamic weights that adjust with market regime (e.g. volatile regime, trending regime, range).

Out-of-Sample / Walk-Forward Testing

Split historical data not just into train/test, but multiple walk-forward segments, to check how your model would‚Äôve done as if deployed in real time.

Ensure Clean, Point-in-Time Data for Macros & Sentiment

Especially for macroeconomic releases, ‚Äúfuture revisions‚Äù are a thing ‚Äî better to use data as it was known at that moment.

Risk & Money Management

Define drawdowns, stop losses, position sizing rules.

Avoid overrisking when the dashboard signals are weak or conflicting.

Avoid Overloading with Redundant Indicators

If several indicators measure the same thing (e.g. trend strength, momentum), combining them might not add value ‚Äî might instead introduce noise.

Use Confirmations & Divergence

For example, use price + volume confirmation, check divergences in momentum, trend + pattern, etc.

Simplicity where possible

Sometimes simpler models with fewer moving parts generalize better and are easier to maintain and interpret.

üîß What you might do to get your own credible stats

Since academic sources are thin, your best move might be to test them yourself (or hire someone to help):

Gather clean historical data for securities you trade (U.S. stocks or whatever).

Write or use software that detects the harmonic patterns with strict rules (Fibonacci levels, tolerances).

Backtest over multiple market conditions (bear, bull, volatile, stable) and different timeframes.

Log every trade: entry point, stop-loss, target, actual outcome, time in trade.

Use realistic estimates of trading cost & execution.

Evaluate across metrics: win rate, profit factor, expectancy, drawdowns, consistency.

üîß What you can do if you want to test ‚ÄúCassiopeia Harmonic Patterns‚Äù or any custom pattern

Since you‚Äôre well-versed, you could put together your own statistical test. Here‚Äôs a rough plan:

Define the pattern exactly

What are the exact price points / Fibonacci ratios / timeframe?

What constitutes entry (e.g. after completion of pattern, certain confirmation candle)?

What is stop‚Äêloss, take‚Äêprofit?

Gather historical data

Get decent quality historical price data for the markets you want to trade (forex, crypto, stocks, etc.).

Clean out bad ticks, account for commission/slippage.

Backtest

Using software (Python, R, or trading platforms) try applying your pattern over past data.

Measure metrics: overall win rate, profit factor, max drawdown, average profit per trade, expectancy.

Walk-forward test or paper trade

Test on unseen data (after the period used for development) to see if the pattern holds.

Or use small live trades (paper money or small capital) to see real-world behavior.

Compare with benchmarks

Compare performance vs simple strategies (moving average crossovers, etc.) to see whether your pattern provides actual added value.

Risk management

Even profitable patterns can lead to large losses if risk per trade or position sizing is poor.
