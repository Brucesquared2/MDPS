| *Integrating Macroeconomic and Technical Indicators into Forecasting the Stock Market* (2025)               | Used macro indicators (volatility, oil, gold, geopolitical risk, economic policy uncertainty, etc.) + technical indicators, deep hybrid neural nets (CNN + GRU / LeNet + Highway etc.) to forecast S&P 500 returns. ([MDPI][1]) | These hybrid models outperformed simpler models. They achieved better accuracy and lower error (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) vs models using just technical or just macro. ([MDPI][1])              |
| *Assessing the Impact of Technical Indicators on Machine Learning Models for Stock Price Prediction* (2024) | Random forest models + various technical indicators (EMA, Fibonacci retracements, Bollinger Bands etc.) on minute-level SPY data (high frequency) ([arXiv][2])                                                                  | The models improved risk-adjusted performance vs baseline, but struggled with out-of-sample generalization. Over-fitting was a problem. ([arXiv][2])                                    |
| *A Comparative Study of MACD-Based Trading Strategies: Evidence from US Stocks*                             | MACD alone and MACD combined with other momentum indicators (RSI, etc.) across indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ, S&P) over ~2015‚Äì2021 ([arXiv][3])                                                                                    | MACD alone had win rate < 50%; combining with other momentum indicators improved win rate & risk-return metrics significantly. ([arXiv][3])                                             |
| *An Improved Reinforcement Learning Model Based on Sentiment Analysis*                                      | Used sentiment indicators + deep RL (DQN, DRQN) + some technical features, designed for higher frequency trading ([arXiv][4])                                                                                                   | They reported a very high annualized return (54.5%) under certain conditions; improvements in Sharpe ratio; but again, risk of overfitting and sensitivity to environment.

| **QTMRL: Multi-Indicator Reinforcement Learning Agent** (2025, arXiv)              | Uses many technical indicators (trend, momentum, volatility) + RL (Actor-Critic) on daily S&P500 & selected stocks (2000-2022) to adapt to market regimes. ([arXiv][1]) | The strategy outperformed baseline strategies (MA crossovers, etc.) in both profitability and risk-adjusted metrics; also reduced downside risk. Exact win-rate numbers depend on stock/market regime. ([arXiv][1])                        |

([fmz.com][3])                                                | Strategy designed to adapt to changing conditions; performance depends heavily on parameter tuning and market (stocks, crypto etc.). Having more indicators helps filter noise but also risks overfitting. ([fmz.com][3])                  |
| **Trading Strategy with Trend Line, Candlestick Patterns & Fibonacci**             | A published article (Trendo) showing combining trend lines + candlesticks + Fibonacci levels to identify better entry points. ([trendo][4])                             | The strategy is more precise than using any single method alone; said to improve ‚Äúwin/loss ratio‚Äù but didn‚Äôt provide large-scale backtest statistics.

| **Gartley**   | ~ 60-75% in many trader/backtest sources. ([Forex News][1]) <br> But in some more rigorous tests, success can drop quite a bit, especially for volatile markets or larger price moves. ([HKUST CSE][2]) | Performs better when patterns are tight, deviation small, and markets relatively stable. Longer timeframes tend to yield more consistent results. ([HKUST CSE][2])                      |
| **Bat**       | Often similar or slightly better than Gartley in certain sources, e.g. ~ 65-78%. ([Forex News][1])                                                                                                      | The Bat pattern tends to give tighter stop-loss options (because the reversal point ‚ÄúD‚Äù is closer to the XA leg) which improves risk/reward when done correctly. ([investaiapp.com][3]) |
| **Butterfly** | More variability: some sources say ~ 55-70%. Some backtests show results up to ~ 80% under very favorable conditions. ([Forex News][1])                                                                 | More extreme extensions (D beyond X) mean more risk, so more false signals, especially if market momentum is strong or trending. Needs other confirming indicators. ([Forex News][1])   |
| **Crab**      | Mixed: some sources claim ~ 60-80%, but the risk/reward is often higher, so losses in bad trades can be bigger. ([Forex News][1])                                                                       | Because Crab often involves deep or extreme extensions, timing matters a lot. Slippage, extended moves, or trend continuation can hurt. ([Liberated Stock Trader][4])                   |

üí° Bottom Line

Yes ‚Äî there are systems/studies that show combining all those tools can yield better performance (improved accuracy, lower drawdowns), particularly when combined smartly (good signal filtering, adaptive thresholds, solid exits). But none of them are perfect and none guarantee performance; the complexity and risk of overfitting means you need to do your own validation.

| **QuantNet: Transferring Learning Across Systematic Trading Strategies** (Koshiyama, Flennerhag, Blumberg, etc.)   | Learns global (market-agnostic) latent features + market-specific models across many equity markets (3103 assets, 58 markets). ([arXiv][1])                                          | Compared to baseline, QuantNet achieved ~ **51% higher Sharpe Ratio** and ~ **69% higher Calmar Ratio**.

([arXiv][2])                                                          | The strategy outperformed equal-weighted alphas and standard benchmarks (S&P 500, etc.) in Sharpe / return metrics for several major stocks. ([arXiv][2]) Suggests that dynamically weighting many signal sources helps adapt to changing market regimes.                      |
| **DNN-ForwardTesting: New Trading Strategy Validation using Time Series and Deep Neural Nets**                     | Uses predicted future paths + many indicators to pick the ‚Äúbest indicator‚Äù for actual trades (not just backtest on fixed indicator set). ([arXiv][3])                                | Reported improvements in several risk-adjusted metrics: Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar; better expectancy vs naive backtests. Suggests using predicted future price series to select which indicators/trends to trust can offer an edge. ([arXiv][3])                                 |
| **A Comparative Evaluation of Predominant Deep Learning Quantified Stock Trading Strategies** (Haohan Zhang, 2021) | Compares various deep learning-based trading strategies under different market stress scenarios. ([arXiv][4])                                                                        | Found that certain DL models can reduce losses in adverse conditions (e.g. markets in drawdowns) better than simple strategies; but returns still highly dependent on model architecture, training / regularization, and input features. ([arXiv][4])                          |
| **Statistical Predictions of Trading Strategies in Electronic Markets** (Cartea, Cohen, Graumans, van Veldhuijzen) | Looks at order flow, algorithm identities, order messages/features to predict direction / price / volume of orders in a regulated exchange (Euronext Amsterdam). ([OUP Academic][5]) | They obtain reliable *out-of-sample predictions* of order direction and price & volume moves using many features; shows microstructure data features (imbalance, inventory, order book depth etc.) can give predictive power. ([OUP Academic][5])                              |
| **Trading Performance and Market Efficiency: Evidence from Algorithmic Trading (India)**                           | Studies performance of algorithmic traders in India, how much they can ‚Äútime‚Äù intraday using VWAP decomposition etc. ([ScienceDirect][6])                                            | Findings: Algo-traders have measurable timing skill, especially over short intervals (1-5 minutes). Increased algorithmic participation improves market efficiency and reduces costs. Profits / returns are positive vs non-algorithmic traders for many. ([ScienceDirect][6]) |

‚öñÔ∏è What These Say About What‚Äôs Possible

From those, you can pull some rough ‚Äúrealistic target zones‚Äù for what a good quant or multi-strategy might achieve, assuming you have solid execution, data, reasonable costs, etc.:

Annualized returns: +8% to +25%+ depending on strategy, market regime, risk. E.g. quant-multi sub-strategies hitting in upper teens is possible, but many quant groups are lower.

Sharpe Ratio: for good quant-multi strategies maybe 1.3-2.5; for plain quant in ‚Äúeveryone average‚Äù maybe 0.7-1.2. Sub-strategies that are high quality can exceed that.

Downside / drawdowns: heavily strategy-dependent. The ‚Äúbear risk‚Äù study suggests that if you limit drawdowns / downside exposure, you can improve consistency + investor comfort.

Volatility: Even good quant strategies often have moderate volatility (5-15% annual or higher depending on frequency); keeping volatility manageable is often just as important as return.

‚úÖ What Seems to Work

From what emerges in the research and implementations:

Combining multiple types of indicators (trend, momentum, volatility, volume) tends to improve signal accuracy vs. using one alone. For example, momentum + trend filters + volatility help avoid false signals.

Adaptive / regime-aware systems (ones that adjust thresholds or which indicators matter depending on market trend vs range vs volatile conditions) tend to preserve capital better and reduce drawdowns.

Using confirmation: e.g. a pattern (Elliott wave, swing count) + a Fibonacci level + maybe a moving average or momentum indicator often gives more reliable entries.

Risk management (stops, position sizing) is critical ‚Äî many losses come not from lack of signal, but from poor exits or letting losses run.

‚úÖ What This Means Practically (for You)

Expect 50-70% success rate in favorable conditions (good instruments, decent timeframe, strict pattern rules).

Profitability hinges on risk/reward, not just win rate: small loss potential + larger reward targets tend to work better.

Combine harmonic pattern detection with confirmation indicators (volume, trend, divergence) to increase the odds.

Consider automating detection & backtesting on your preferred markets/instruments to see what's working in ‚Äúyour patch‚Äù (stocks, forex, crypto, agri-commodities,

 etc.).

üîç What I did find

There is some reference on older sites (e.g. FxGroundworks) that claim very high success rates for ‚Äúharmonic patterns‚Äù (80-95%) across nearly 3,000 patterns. 
Geocities

But these sources are not peer-reviewed, and often lack detail about sample bias, trade entry/exit rules, slippage, or selection criteria.

Such numbers should be taken with skepticism because they often reflect idealized backtests rather than live trading conditions.

I found nothing credible or detailed using the specific name ‚ÄúCassiopeia Harmonic Patterns‚Äù in reputed journals, trading forums, or quant research databases. No win-rates, no statistical backtests, no comparisons vs benchmark or random entry.
