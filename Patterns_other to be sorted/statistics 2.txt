statistics

how about using candle counters, trend counters, swing counters, elliot wave patterns, fibonacci ratios, trend lines, moving averages, range meters fan (up/down) projections, all into one cohesive trading system to help in analysis for up trends, down trends, wave patterns, and other candle and harmonic patterns in conjunction with all together into a cohesive python trading quant to use with other indicators. Does this have statistics or findings anywhere?

Yes ‚Äî there are studies and strategy examples that combine many of the elements you listed (candlestick / trend counters / swing counts / Elliott Waves / Fibonacci / moving averages / etc.) into cohesive quant‚Äêsystems. The evidence is mixed, but some show promise. Below are what I found, what seems to work, and key pitfalls. If you want, I can try pulling together a summary of backtests for something very close to your ideal system.

üîç What Actually Exists: Studies & Strategy Implementations

Here are some relevant research / implemented strategies that approximate what you‚Äôre describing:

Title / Source	What It Does	Key Findings / Stats
QTMRL: Multi-Indicator Reinforcement Learning Agent (2025, arXiv)	Uses many technical indicators (trend, momentum, volatility) + RL (Actor-Critic) on daily S&P500 & selected stocks (2000-2022) to adapt to market regimes. 
arXiv
	The strategy outperformed baseline strategies (MA crossovers, etc.) in both profitability and risk-adjusted metrics; also reduced downside risk. Exact win-rate numbers depend on stock/market regime.

NEAT Algorithm-based Strategy with Multiple Technical Indicators (Dec 2024)	Uses ‚ÄúNeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies‚Äù to evolve strategy rules combining many indicators. 
arXiv
	It achieved returns similar to buy & hold in many cases, but with lower risk and more stability (smoother equity curve). Not always beating buy & hold, but offering better drawdown behavior.

Multi-Indicator Dynamic Adaptive Quantitative Strategy (FMZ community example)	Combines TEMA, KAMA (adaptive moving averages), MACD, RSI, ATR, volume, with filtering & risk management. 
fmz.com
	Strategy designed to adapt to changing conditions; performance depends heavily on parameter tuning and market (stocks, crypto etc.). Having more indicators helps filter noise but also risks overfitting.

Trading Strategy with Trend Line, Candlestick Patterns & Fibonacci	A published article (Trendo) showing combining trend lines + candlesticks + Fibonacci levels to identify better entry points. 
trendo
	The strategy is more precise than using any single method alone; said to improve ‚Äúwin/loss ratio‚Äù but didn‚Äôt provide large-scale backtest statistics. It‚Äôs more of a how to use these together than full quantitative proof.

Synergizing Quant Models + Market Microstructure	Combines RSI, EMA, VWAP, MACD in India‚Äôs NSE, with backtesting. 
ScienceDirect
	Found ~ 60.6% profitable trades, profit factor ~ 1.88. Shows combination of multiple indicators outperforms some single indicator strategies.

‚úÖ What Seems to Work

From what emerges in the research and implementations:

Combining multiple types of indicators (trend, momentum, volatility, volume) tends to improve signal accuracy vs. using one alone. For example, momentum + trend filters + volatility help avoid false signals.

Adaptive / regime-aware systems (ones that adjust thresholds or which indicators matter depending on market trend vs range vs volatile conditions) tend to preserve capital better and reduce drawdowns.

Using confirmation: e.g. a pattern (Elliott wave, swing count) + a Fibonacci level + maybe a moving average or momentum indicator often gives more reliable entries.

Risk management (stops, position sizing) is critical ‚Äî many losses come not from lack of signal, but from poor exits or letting losses run.

‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls & What Studies Warn About

Overfitting risk: The more indicators, the more parameters. Without careful validation / out-of-sample testing, you may get a system that worked historically but fails live.

Subjectivity: Especially for Elliott Wave, trendlines, swing counting ‚Äî definitions can vary, results depend heavily on the person coding/drawing them. That subjectivity can reduce reproducibility / statistical confidence.

Complexity vs clarity: Too many indicators or conflicting signals can lead to missed opportunities (if you wait for all confirmations) or confusion.

Signal frequency reduction: More confirmation usually means fewer trade signals. That can hurt if you need more volume or scaling to make returns meaningful.

Cost, latency, slippage: Real execution issues tend to degrade results compared to backtest.

üßÆ Example: How Your Ideal System Could Perform / Be Tested

If you built a system that includes:

Candlestick pattern detector

Swing / wave counter (swing highs / lows / Elliott Wave)

Trend indicators (MAs, ADX, trendlines)

Fibonacci retracements / extensions

Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.)

Volume & volatility filters

You‚Äôd want to test it like this:

Clean historical data (preferably minute or hourly if you're trading shorter timeframes, or daily for longer).

Automate detection of each pattern/indicator with clear rule sets (e.g. define ‚Äúwave count‚Äù algorithmically rather than manually).

Define entry and exit rules (which indicator combos needed for entry, stop loss, take profit).

Backtest across multiple markets (stocks, commodities, forex) and multiple market regimes (bull, bear, range).

Use walk-forward or rolling window test to avoid lookahead bias.

Measure standard metrics: win rate, profit factor, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, return over risk, etc.

üí° Bottom Line

Yes ‚Äî there are systems/studies that show combining all those tools can yield better performance (improved accuracy, lower drawdowns), particularly when combined smartly (good signal filtering, adaptive thresholds, solid exits). But none of them are perfect and none guarantee performance; the complexity and risk of overfitting means you need to do your own validation.

If you want, I can try to build some sample backtest results for your exact combination (candles + swings/waves + trendlines + Fibonacci + moving averages + others) using U.S. stock data, just to see what kind of metrics you might expect. Do you want me to put together a prototype result like that?
